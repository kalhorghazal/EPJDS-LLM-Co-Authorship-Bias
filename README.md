# Directories

Our analysis scripts are classified into the following folders:

* **Fairness Analysis**: This directory contains the Python scripts we used to calculate the number of matched co-authors' names for each author and fairness metrics, including demographic parity, predictive equality, conditional demographic parity, and conditional predictive equality.

* **Network Analysis**: This directory contains the Python codes we used to build the Google Scholar co-authorship network and the LLM-constructed co-authorship network. It also includes the script for comparing the structural features of the two networks.
